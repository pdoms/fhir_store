# A database for fhir resources written in Rust

# IMPORTANT: I am prototyping at the moment. This code is neither finished and rather overambitious.

That being said, I believe that database designed for one specific purpose, instead
of trying to cover every case is somewhat one direction database design will take.

That being said, the moment I feel comfortable to present this fully to the world.
A crate shall be released and a proper instructions will be available. However, I think
no one will actually stumble upon this repo (won't be ranke too high if one searches
for 'FHIR database' or similiar queries), but it shall remain public under the MIT
license.
